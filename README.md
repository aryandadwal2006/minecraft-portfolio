## Instructions

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Updates!!!

- Set flat={true} on your Canvas component to get rid of tonemapping issues!
- Added a rotation buffer to smooth rotations.
- I did end up adding a camera group so the offset was according to its local axis instead of the global one, it felt better that way.
